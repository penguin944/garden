# Pleimann Garden Dashboard

### Warning: This application is under heavy development.

At this time, while it does work, serving the javascripts from WebBrick is excruciatingly slow. Will convert to Webpack to improve load times.

This is my attempt at building my first Ruby on Rails application. It uses an API only Rails backend with and Angular2 frontend served with Rails asset pipeline.
